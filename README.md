# Portfolio v1
This webpage was my initial portfolio. It domonstrates knowledge in React.js, web-hooks, HTML, CSS, Scroll Effects, multiple page integration, and decent Web-Design. Obviously the look and feel of this site wasn't quite right to me, because I redesigned it in my [portfolio v2](https://github.com/bdgcypher/portfolio-v2). Do you think I improved on anything?
